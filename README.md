## Introduction
This repository contains my research of the well known [Fisher’s Iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) with written documentation and code in Python for my project. 
I downloaded the [irish data set](IrisDataSet.csv) from [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv).

### About Fisher's Iris data set.

The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set. It consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris Flowers — Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor, under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species).
It was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper [“The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems”.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x)
