## Introduction
This repository contains my research of the well known [Fisherâ€™s Iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) with written documentation and code in Python for my project. 
I downloaded the [irish data set](IrisDataSet.csv) from [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv).
